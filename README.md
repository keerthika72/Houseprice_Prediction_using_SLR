# Houseprice_Prediction_using_SLR
This is a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on their area using a Simple Linear Regression model.
Predicts house prices based on area (square feet/meters). Uses a pre-trained simple linear regression model for accurate predictions.
We use python and its libraries and Streamlit for building interactive web application.
